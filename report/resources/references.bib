    abstract = {Web caching has been recognized as an effective approach to improve performance by storing frequently-accessed documents from originating servers at storage sites "closer" to requesting clients in order to reduce the load on the network bandwidth which in turn can reduce user response time. In this paper, we examine the performance of various architectures for cache cooperation in a web environment. The architectures under consideration include: distributed, hierarchical, and a hybrid of the two. A hierarchical web caching architecture utilizes a series of caches placed at different levels of the network (i.e. client, institutional, regional, and national) and user requests are satisfied at the lowest level possible (the first one that stores the desired document). Distributed web caching incorporates multiple cooperating caches all at the same level. The hybrid approach chosen in this paper contains a hierarchy of distributed caches in the hopes of exploiting advantages from both distributed and hierarchical caching. Using simulation as the tool, we compare the performance (mean response time, overall cache hit rates) of these architectures under a variety of different scenarios in an attempt to identify the conditions under which each is beneficial.},

Zipf's law plays an important role in solving the Internet latency, and holds the promise of more effective design and use of Web cache resources.",

    abstract = {This paper presents a traffic characterization study of the popular video sharing service, YouTube. Over a three month period we observed almost 25 million transactions between users on an edge network and YouTube, including more than 600,000 video downloads. We also monitored the globally popular videos over this period of time.In the paper we examine usage patterns, file properties, popularity and referencing characteristics, and transfer behaviors of YouTube, and compare them to traditional Web and media streaming workload characteristics. We conclude the paper with a discussion of the implications of the observed characteristics. For example, we find that as with the traditional Web, caching could improve the end user experience, reduce network bandwidth consumption, and reduce the load on YouTube's core server infrastructure. Unlike traditional Web caching, Web 2.0 provides additional meta-data that should be exploited to improve the effectiveness of strategies like caching.},

    abstract = {The commonly agreed Zipf-like access pattern of Web workloads is mainly based on Internet measurements when text-based content dominated the Web traffic. However, with dramatic increase of media traffic on the Internet, the inconsistency between the access patterns of media objects and the Zipf model has been observed in a number of studies. An insightful understanding of media access patterns is essential to guide Internet system design and management, including resource provisioning and performance optimizations.In this paper, we have studied a large variety of media workloads collected from both client and server sides in different media systems with different delivery methods. Through extensive analysis and modeling, we find: (1) the object reference ranks of all these workloads follow the stretched exponential (SE) distribution despite their different media systems and delivery methods; (2) one parameter of this distribution well characterizes the media file sizes, the other well characterizes the aging of media accesses; (3) some biased measurements may lead to Zipf-like observations on media access patterns; and (4) the deviation of media access pattern from the Zipf model in these workloads increases along with the workload duration.We have further analyzed the effectiveness of media caching with a mathematical model. Compared with Web caching under the Zipf model, media caching under the SE model is far less effective unless the cache size is enormously large. This indicates that many previous studies based on a Zipf-like assumption have potentially overestimated the media caching benefit, while an effective media caching system must be able to scale its storage size to accommodate the increase of media content over a long time. Our study provides an analytical basis for applying a P2P model rather than a client-server model to build large scale Internet media delivery systems.},
