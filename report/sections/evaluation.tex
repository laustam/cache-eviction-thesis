\chapter{Evaluation}

miss ratio and byte ratio the same in this case since each object 

\section{Limitations}

- drawback of using synthetic workloads: not representative of real production systems (cite twitter-analysis)

- major drawback is not having access to open source production stuff

- limited understanding of distributions IRL

- we dont consider throughput; issues with das-5 setup!

- didnt consider that each object has different size IRL (cite some shit here), assumption that each object == 1 byte

- not realistic because cache size small and workload small; sieve paper in comparison had several millions of requests

- no warming up the cache

- did not evaluate if the number of requests changes shit -> future work?
