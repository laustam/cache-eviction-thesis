\outline{Ideas for future work}

- test with proprietary traces

- more traces need to be available for use! (cite twitter-analysis here)

- running same algorithms on different production traces grouped by use case, and seeing whether there are trends there. for example, social media trends could be very different to others maybe

- looking at throughput as well, since not only efficiency matters lol
